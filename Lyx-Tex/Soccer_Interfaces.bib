Using NHL regular-season data from 2005–2010, we identify four forward types, four defensemen types, and three goalie types. Goalies tend to contribute the most to team performance, followed by forwards and then defensemen. We also show that once we account for salary cap and playing-time information, the value of different player types may become similar. Lastly, we illustrate how to use the regression results to analyze trades and their impact on team performance. },

This brings about a new ‘culture’ of statistical modelling that bears considerable potential for the social scientist. This argument is illustrated with a brief discussion of model-based recursive partitioning which can bridge the theory and data-driven approach. Such a method is an example of how this new approach can help revise models that work for the full dataset: it can be used for evaluating different models, a traditional weakness of the ‘traditional’ statistical approach used in social science. },
